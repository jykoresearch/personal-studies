## 01. Optimizer to develop a model and to find an optimal point  
This is a simple code to let other researchers learn basic Python optimizers. 
The steps are as follows:
1) Develop experimental model with parameter optimizer.
2) Find out optimal point with python optimizer again. 

## 2. PRML â€” examples for pattern recognition and machine learning
Practices for learning Bayesian methods. 
1) Maximum likelihood curve fitting vs. Bayesian curve fitting. 

## 3. pymc examples
